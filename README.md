# rust-bbb-experiments

Experimenting with Rust on the Beaglebone Black.

NOTE: I don't have anything working yet. I'm learning from https://github.com/posborne/rust-sysfs-gpio and plan to use this is a base for developing some sample code for various aspects of robotics, such as interfacing with ultrasonic sensors, motor controllers, and SPI devices.

Notes

```
docker run -t -i -v `pwd`:/source andygrove/rust_bbb
